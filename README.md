# Profile Card

This project has been created the code from [tom.is.coding](https://www.instagram.com/tom.is.coding?igsh=MWx6enkybTR0aGcweQ==) on Instagram who built a Profile Card. 

I have used SCSS and compiled this down to CSS in order to style the card and make this work as intended. I have also decided to add extra copy as a heading and footer to show how this could work as part of an element in a fully functioning web page (watch this space). 

If you would like to view my version of the profile card please [click here]()
